# Instructions!!
## If you want code
 - To run on xcode: just put all the code in and run it lol
 - To run on a unix/linux/mac command line:
   - clone it (google that if you don't know)
   - type `./compile` to compile
   - type `./main` to run.
   - enjoy.
## If you just want to run:
- download the file called main, goto that directory using `cd`
- use `chmod +x main` to make the file runnable, then do `./main`
- if you want to run on windows, idk man
